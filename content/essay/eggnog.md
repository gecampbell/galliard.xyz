+++

Stolen/borrowed/adapted from Alex Scrivener on FriendFeed:

* 4 cups Blended Whiskey (preferably Canadian)
* 2 cups Brandy
* 1 cup dark Jamaican Rum
* 1 cup light Puerto Rican Rum.
* 1 dozen eggs
* 1 pound sugar
* 1 quart whole milk
* 1 quart heavy cream.

Separate eggs.

Whisk sugar and yolks together until smooth.

Pour in liquor slowly, whisking constantly.
This will cook the yolks, so if they aren't whisked smooth with the sugar you will have bits of yellow floating in the nog.

Add dairy, still whisking.

Beat egg whites to soft peaks, then fold in.

Let sit in the fridge for 24 hours.
Serve with fresh-ground nutmeg on top in very small glasses.[^1]

[^1]: I can't emphasize enough that the glasses should be small. Very, very small.
