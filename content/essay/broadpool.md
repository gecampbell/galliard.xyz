I was lucky enough to live in England from February, 1996, through
October, 2000. At the time, I was working for a startup company
called Evolutionary Technologies International (ETI) that sold an
enterprise-class data migration (<abbr title="Extract, Transform,
and Load">ETL</abbr>) tool.  We had offices in [Bracknell,
Berkshire](https://goo.gl/maps/Kyg5t4BKkY92), which is just west
of London, on the train line to Reading.

When I moved to England, there were only 3 of us; myself and one
other American consultant, and then a senior salesperson who was
hired by our vice president in Paris. Relocating overseas is quite
the experience; part exhilarating, part terrifying, and never dull.

Before we made the permanent move, my wife and I went over on a
"house-hunting trip." This involved 3-4 days of frantic searching
with a relocation agent before we settled on a lovely little house
in Ascot, part of a group of houses called "Broadpool Cottages."
Ascot, if you're unfamiliar, is the home of the [Royal Ascot
Racecourse](https://www.ascot.co.uk/), a horse-racing facility just
a few miles down the road from Windsor.

[Broadpool Cottages](https://goo.gl/maps/LA7vffSSwGB2) is a group
of eight houses on a small spur of land that used to be part of
Windsor Great Park. The Great Park is, in essence, the royal front
yard of Windsor Castle.  In fact, Broadpool Cottages is actually
owned by the royal family; it's part of the private property owned
by the Windsors, and not part of the (much larger) set of properties
that are held in trust for the nation by the Queen. So, in fact,
HRH Queen Elizabeth II was our landlady (though, sadly, all the
affairs were handled by a property management company).

After moving out of our 1600 square foot home in Austin, Texas, the
house at #7 Broadpool Cottages seemed time (it was only 1100').
Downstairs, there was a kitchen, a dining room, a living room, and
a spare room (sort of an extra bedroom, but we used it as a guest
room and then as an office). There was also a half bath downstairs,
a laundry room, and a storage area under the stairs.  Upstairs,
there was a master bedroom/bathroom suite, and two extra bedrooms
and a bath. One of the bedrooms was what the British call a "box
room" (meaning that it's so tiny, you can really only use it to
store your boxes).

There was a cute little yard that backed up to the spur of the Great
Park; essentially, a lovely pine forest with walking trails that
was covered in enormous ferns at ground level.  Our son attended
the [Licensed Victualler's School](http://www.lvs.ascot.sch.uk/home)
down the road towards Bracknell.  The school was a mile or so away
from Martins Heron, a housing development that was used as the
setting for the Dursley's house in the Harry Potter series of movies
(though those were not filmed until after we had moved back to the
USA).

My primary domain name is [broadpool.com](http://broadpool.com), 
inspired by this little house.
