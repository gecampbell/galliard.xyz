As those of you who follow me on the various social media platforms are
probably already aware, I started a new job at Amazon.com on the first
of June. I'm a software development manager with a couple of teams in the
retail division. One team is a platform that's used by a dozen or more
other major systems, and the other team maintains the user interface
for one of those crucial systems.

Amazon is a fascinating, enormous company, and I'm just getting a glimpse
of how it has evolved. I'm lucky in that I've actually been an Amazon customer
since its earliest days (I even participated in the Beta launch of
Amazon.co.uk when I lived in England in the late 1990's).

Since I started work on June 1, I'm slowly getting up to speed.
One of the things that Amazon does well, however, is to scale things,
and that includes the ability to hire very large numbers of people and
get them productive rapidly. They have an exciting culture where
software developers (in particular) take ownership of their systems;
most of the work is performed by the teams directly, which means that
they can move very rapidly, unlike many other large companies.

Stay tuned as I learn more about it.
