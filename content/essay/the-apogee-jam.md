I've been a big fan of Apogee products since I started using the
[Apogee ONE](http://glenc.co/2010/09/08/the-apogee-one/) audio
interface a few years ago. While the Apogee ONE is a powerful,
portable audio interface that plugs into your laptop, the company
has taken the idea one step further and produced the [Apogee
JAM](http://www.apogeedigital.com/products/jam.php), a guitar-only
interface that plugs directly into your iPhone (or iPad) for the
ultimate in portability.

The JAM, when coupled with a mobile app like
[Garageband](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785?mt=8)
($4.99), provides the equivalent of $250,000 worth of recording
equipment in the 1980's. Its nearest competitor is the [iRig]()
from IK Multimedia; the biggest difference I can see is that the
iRig provides an analog signal via the iPhone's microphone input,
while the JAM does the onboard analog to digital conversion and
sends the digital signal via the device's USB port. While I haven't
tested or compared the two of them directly, I'm much more inclined
to think that the pure digital signal will be higher quality than
the analog one, which could be modified, for example, by the quality
of the metal-to-metal contacts in the microphone port (i.e., if you
jiggle the plug, it can "scratch" the sound). I will say that the
iRig is much less expensive ($39.99) than the JAM ($99.99).

There are some very cool apps for the iPhone/iPad that will work
with either connector.

* [AmpKit+](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ampkit+/id385758778?mt=8)
  ($19.99 +add-ons) from Agile Partners is an amplifier modeling
  kit&mdash;in essence, it provides digital signal modification that
  will allow your guitar to sound like it's being played through any
  combination of amplifier or effects boxes.
* [AmpliTube](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ampkit+/id385758778?mt=8)
  ($19.99 +add-ons) is a similar concept, though it of courses
  focuses on tube amp modeling.

Both these apps let you purchase add-ons that will extend the range
of amps, speakers, effect, etc., that can be modeled.

While I imagine that many folks will not be using these for live
performance, the quality is actually quite good. Here's my poor
guitar playing through AmpKit+:

Remember&mdash;that was entirely recorded on an iPhone, with no
external equipment involved.
