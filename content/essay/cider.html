In the last few months, I've taken a liking to cider. 
This is not the apple juice drink that you might have grown up with,
but "hard cider," usually 5-7% alcohol by volume (ABV).
For me, it's much more enjoyable than the vast majority of beers.
(I'll be honest; there are very few beers that I really enjoy,
so I tend to stay away from them.)
