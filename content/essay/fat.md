Most of you who know me (except for perhaps the very few who met me
in elementary school) know that I've always been fat. "Big," "heavy,"
"large"&mdash;these are some of the euphemisms I've grown up with.
I never noticed my weight until junior high school.
Until that point, I was just a big kid, and this was an advantage
when I tried out for Little League baseball or play football. 

In junior high, however, we had to "suit up" for <abbr title="Physical
Education">PE</abbr>, aka gym class.  The first day of class, we
had to go to the locker room, take off all our clothes, and put on
the supplied jockstraps and gray woolen gym shorts. For the first
time in my life, someone pointed at the little rolls of fat around
by belly and laughed. Until that second, I had no idea that I was
anything other than a perfectly normal kid.

When I was in high school, my interests were more in poetry and
music rather than sports. I still rode my bicycle everywhere and
was, I believe, in reasonably good shape, but my parents put me on
a miserable 1500 calorie per day diet which didn't, as I recall,
do much good.  I rode my bicycle competitively a few times; I wasn't
ever a winner, but I finished every race I entered and was never
in last place.[^1]

When I went off to college, I bought a tuxedo (required for orchestra
members) with size 44" pants. I wore that tux numerous times for
performances as well as other formal events over the next four
years. By the end of school, however, it was getting tight. While
in college, I took the required four PE classes; for me, these
included two semesters of cycling and another two of sailing.  I
went on long rides with other cyclists at Baylor, and even had a
rather spectacular crash when I hit a small patch of water at the
bottom of a very steep hill in Waco's Cameron Park. I had no broken
bones, but I managed to scrape most of the skin off my entire right
side, from the legs to the hips to the shoulder and even on my face.
It was a spectacular-looking injury, but no major damage was done.
When I left college to go to work in Austin, I sold my bicycle since
I had moved to a house farther from campus and riding was not easy
to keep up (and probably my as-yet-undiagnosed <abbr title="Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> meant that I had new
interests).

In Austin, I lived in suburban apartments and commuted by car to
work.  I had no concept, even then, of deliberate physical activity.
That is, it never actually crossed my mind that I had to do something
to be healthy. Fitness was something that just happened when I was
doing things that I enjoyed. But photography and playing the guitar
do not consume as many calories as riding a bicycle or hiking, and
my weight was slowly creeping up, unknown to me, fueled by a steady
diet of pizza, fajitas, and the best BBQ around.

In 1996, I moved to England. I was still a "big guy," but my weight
was not out of control.  Living and working in England (and much
of Europe and South Africa) involved a lot of walking: you walked
from the train station to the office, from the office to the pub,
and so forth. So, again, of necessity, I was getting exercise without
needing to think about it.  I took up golf, too, and that was
probably a healthy change.

In 2000, I left my job in the UK and returned to the USA: Silicon
Valley, at the height of the boom. I went to work for a startup;
this involved commuting (by car), and walking across the parking
lot for those calorie-laden foods that I'd been missing in my four
years overseas.  In my first eight months back in the USA, my weight
zoomed up 65 lbs.  I only know this because I weighed in at the
doctor and thought to myself, "Hmmm, that's a bit more than I
remember from last time." I didn't, however, think much more about
it.

My time with a startup was followed by several years of near-total
unemployment. When you're unemployed, golf is not something you
spend money on. Unbeknownst to me, my weight was slowly climbing.
Several jobs later, I found myself with a bad back, sore knees,
arthritis, and a profound tendency to breath deeply if I had to
walk a slight upwards slope. Because of the back pain, I avoided
walking.  When I moved back to Texas to take a new job in 2010, I
weighed about 420lbs (which I jokingly referred to as "a fifth of
a ton") and wore size 62" pants.

When we moved to Texas, we got a new, larger, softer bed than we
had ever had before.  [The effect on my life was amazing, as I've
written about before](/essay/2011/04/a-good-nights-sleep.html).

In 2011, [my brother Mark unexpectedly
died](/essay/2011/03/goodbye-bro.html) of an aortic aneurysm. Doctors
recommended that I and my remaining brothers get checked out, in
case the condition was genetic. So I went off to the doctor for an
ultrasound.  It turns out that I did not have an aneurysm, but they
detected a slightly enlarged liver. This turned out to be the early
stages of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.  My gastroenterologist
recommended losing weight and, with the assistance of the new bed,
I managed to drop down to around 350lbs.

Unfortunately, this wasn't really enough, and my doctor recommended
bariatric surgery. I was not very inclined to give up eating; plus,
bariatric surgery was, at that time, considered "experimental" and
thus was not covered by insurance.  That changed in 2014, when my
employer added bariatric surgery to their list of covered treatments.
Finally, in December 2014, I underwent a *sleeve gastrectomy*; in
this procedure, about 80% of my stomach was removed.

There are several different types of bariatric (weight-loss) surgery.
The first kind (popularized by Al Roker on NBC's "Today" show) was
the gastric bypass. This involves removing the stomach almost
entirely, and requires significant changes in diet and lifestyle
for the rest of your life. The *lap band* is another surgery where
they apply an adjustable band around the stomach to artificially
reduce it's size. It has a bad track record of side effects (it's
prone to infection, for example) and, once it's removed, your stomach
returns to its original size.

The *gastric sleeve,* on the other hand, removes a large part of
your stomach, but leaves a small "sleeve" of it behind. Because
your stomach is still there and functioning, you can still take
oral medication, and you can pretty much eat anything, though you
can't consume more than about 4-5 ounces of anything at a time.

(Note: all these surgeries are valid, and offer different options
for different patients. If you're considering this, talk to your
doctor about what's right for you; there may be reasons in your
case to choose one over the other.)

*This is me in 2011 (left) and July 2014 (right)*

Since December 2014 (when I weighed 360 lbs), I've lost a bit more
than 100 lbs; last week, my weight was 254 lbs (fully clothed; at
home, I typically don't wear clothes when weighing in). Coupled
with a [move to Seattle](/essay/2015/06/amazon.html), I've been
walking regularly, going to the gym, and working out at home with
kettlebells.

Within a month after the surgery, I stopped taking high blood
pressure medication and the cholesterol medications I've been on
for years.  I still use a CPAP for sleep apnea (according to the
doctor, my apnea is mostly caused by a generic malformation of my
palate, and not necessarily by my weight, though the obesity didn't
help matters).

The surgery sometimes causes frustrations. I can't, for example,
drink anything immediately after eating (that tends to make the
food expand and lead to vomiting), so no more bagel+coffee. I have
to wait an hour or so after eating before I can drink anything.
Because I can't eat enough, I will have to take substantial vitamins
for the rest of my life. I need to keep my protein up, so I usually
have a protein shake for breakfast (my target is 85 grams of protein
per day).  But I can have a hamburger, even if I can't have a coke
to go with it.  I've also developed an occasional aversion to eggs,
which is somewhat frustrating, too. I'm prone to cheating (such as
grabbing some caramel candies in the evening) which certainly makes
the weight loss go slower than it would otherwise.

I tell this story so that it will be documented. I'm not trying to
prove anything to anyone, or recommend a particular course of action.
If you can lose weight without surgery, that's probably a far better
course to take if you can do it (and I'm supremely proud of my
double-first cousin Jim, who managed to do just that).

I am looking forward to getting back on a bicycle soon, however. 


[^1]: I actually rode against Greg Lemond in a race in Houston when he
      was an up-and-coming youth cycling star. I'm pretty sure I finished 
      behind him.
