My wife and I spent two weeks traveling around England in December 2017.
We visited Avebury and Stonehenge on one cold day, and this was the 
best photo that I took during the trip.

I took several dozen photos there, and we walked around the whole
structure. I kept looking for the best vantage point. Like
much of the time in England, the weather was highly variable. 
Even in the few hours that we were there, it rained, it was
sunny, and then this clearing scene during the last few minutes
before sunset arrived.
