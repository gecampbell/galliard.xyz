If you have somehow managed to find this site, you are either curious
about the name `xlerb`, or you already know what it means. If you already
know what it means, then there's probably not much point in reading
further.

`xlerb` is a "word that doesn't exist in the dictionary." It was coined by
Leo Brodie in the seminal programming tome
[Starting Forth](http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/).
Forth, if you're not aware, is made up of "words" that decompose into
smaller words, which ultimately end up written in assembler.
Forth maintains a dictionary of words, and scans it for each word in
its input stream.

`xlerb` is not a word.

So now you know the rest of the story.
