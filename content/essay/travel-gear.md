I spent the past weekend traveling in Iceland. This has long been a 
"bucket list" item for me, and it did not disappoint.

Iceland is a land of fabulous scenery almost everywhere you look.
In fact, it's so stunning that you're at a loss to know where to begin.
When I arrived on Thursday morning, I picked up my rental car and
headed to Kirkjufell, the famous "church mountain" on the
Snæfelssness peninsula. However, I found myself pulling over to
the side of the road every few minutes to take pictures in the
stunning landscape.

As is usual for me, I carried far too much gear, clothing, and equipment.
In this post, I'll go through what I carried, what was used, and what I'd
leave behind if I did it again.

## Clothing

My primary outerwear was an Eddie Bauer down jacket. I wore this every
day, all the time. No complaints at all. This particular model can be stuffed
into one of its pockets, and I used this feature to stow the coat in
one of my pieces of luggage on both legs of the
airplane flight.

Long underwear, wool: I brought two pairs of these and did not use them at
all. In fact, since I was driving in a car, I could simply get back
in the car if my legs got cold (which they did once or twice).
However, I suspect that if I had gone for a hike of more than 30 minutes 
or so, I would have really appreciated them. 

Shirts: I only carried two shirts plus the shirt I traveled in, and this was
adequate for a four-day, three night trip. I wore merino wool undershirts
and those not only helped keep me warm but also meant that the outer
shirts didn't get all stinky.

Shoes: I only wore one pair of shoes, Lowa hiking boots. They are Gore-Tex 
insulated and waterproof, and were perfect. (They were a bit annoying at
the guesthouse where we were required to remove our shoes at the door,
however.)

I had two pullover sweaters/sweatshirts. These were redundant, and I could
have been totally happy with just one of them. 

## Cameras

I carried a full
[Sony A7rIV](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm4)
kit with several lenses, a 
[Leica M10-P](https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-M/Leica-M10-P)
with
a single lens, and a
[Leica Q2](https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-Q/Leica-Q2),
which spent most of the time on the
passenger seat of my rental car. All of these are superb cameras but, 
somewhat to my surprise, I used the Sony much less than the other two.
Basically, the Sony was used when I needed a long telephoto lens, and 
I used the Leicas for everything else.

The M10-P, somewhat to my surprise, turned out some of the best photos of
the entire trip. It's incredibly sharp, and handheld pictures were superb.
Most people don't normally think of the manual-focus M10 as a
landscape camera, but it did a superb job, albeit limited in 
focal length.

The Q2 was really the workhorse. I could grab it and go, and pictures were
invariably of high quality. Its 28mm lens is stellar, and I got
high-quality photos even in crop mode. When I put it on a tripod, 
slow shutter speeds allowed for smooth water effects on waterfalls, and
nearly every image was of usable quality.

Honestly, if I ever do a trip like this again, I'll limit myself 
to two cameras: the Sony plus one or two telephoto lenses, and the
Q2 for everything else (though I dearly love the M10-P).

## Luggage

Camera gear traveled in an
[f-Stop Ajna](https://fstopgear.com/products/packs/ajna).
This is a 40L bag that can be
carried on (the 50L Tilopa is a better bag but too large for carry-on size).
My tripod was attached to the outside. 

I also had a 
[Tom Bihn Synik 30L](https://www.tombihn.com/products/synik-30?variant=31677198204991)
for my personal item on the plane. It held
my headphones, medicine, iPad, and other small items such as charging
cables and batteries. 

My clothes traveled in an Away wheeled carry-on bag. Since it was checked, 
I probably could have used a larger bag, had I wanted.
