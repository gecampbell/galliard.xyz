We have a bread machine that we sometimes pull out and use.
It will make a 2lb loaf, which is very large for a bread machine,
so it can be cumbersome to set up and use. 
Since we've moved into our new house, it's been in storage for a few months
and then in a closet, so I got it out last night to make some
simple white bread (our favorite
<abbr title="Butter Delivery Vehicle">BDV</abbr>).
Since most of the recipes are for a smaller loaf, I adapted this one
to make a full-sized loaf.

----

* 10 oz hot water
* 2 teaspoons yeast
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 4 cups white flour

Put hot water, yeast and sugar in your bread machine.
Let it stand for 10-15 minutes depending on the temp of your water.
The yeast will foam.

Add remaining ingredients.

Use rapid or basic white cycles.
