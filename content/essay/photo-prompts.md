A few weeks ago, I mentioned to a friend of mine that I wanted to become more 
deliberate in my photography. I started photography as a hobby shortly after
college, where I was inspired by a professor who practiced large-format
photography. My first love was
[Ansel Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams)
and his breathtaking photographs of the American west. 

My budget didn't allow for a 4x5 camera, however, so I mostly worked with a
fairly primitive (by today's standards) Canon SLR; it had automatic exposure 
but manual focus. I shot primarily in B&W, not only because of my preoccupation
with Ansel Adams, but because I could buy the film in bulk and develop it in my
bathroom, thus making it a relatively cheap way to practice. 

I've been an "enthusiast" photographer since then (about 1983) and I've used
a variety of cameras since then. In the late 1990's, I encountered a wonderful
group of people via the Contax G Pages, a mailing list (and later a website)
for users of the Contax G-series autofocus rangefinder cameras. These were
small, lightweight cameras with superb Zeiss lenses, and I learned a lot about
photography by discussing the craft with the other photographers in that
group (which numbered over 2,000 at its peak).

So, my friend and I decided that we needed to challenge each other, 
photographically speaking.  Below is a list of proposed photo topics
to work on, one for each week of the year (plus a few extra). 

## How it works

1. Each week, take one or more photos of the assigned topic. 
1. Post the photo to your favorite photo-sharing site (Instagram, Flickr, 500px, etc.) and make sure that it's publicly-viewable. 
1. Tweet a link to the photo with the hashtag `#photoprompt`. Feel free to add any other `#hashtags` or description. 

Want to follow along? Just follow the
