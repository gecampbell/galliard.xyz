I don't particularly like beer, but I've discovered (since moving to the
Pacific Northwest) that I really, really like cider. On a trip to Europe in
May 2019, I discovered that there are some beers that I enjoy, too, but those
are mostly of the Kolsch-style and not too common these days. (For the
record, I cannot stand the IPAs that are so popular; why someone 
would want to lick a pine tree is beyond me).

*(Note: I started this as a simple text file, but I'll try to add links
to the brewers over time.)*

Ratings:

1. Don’t do this again
2. Probably not, but it’s unusual so I might be in the mood for it
3. Just ok
4. Very nice; definitely put this in the rotation
5. Absolutely superb

## Cider 

* 5 - 1066 by St-Lô Cider, 7.5%, absolutely fabulous, but really difficult to find.
* 4 - [Snowdrift](http://www.snowdriftcider.com) Forefather, 7.5% (ABV), very nice! Sweeter than I expected. Pale gold color.  
* 5 - [Snowdrift](http://www.snowdriftcider.com) Red, 7.5%, ooh lovely. Pink, not too sweet, but very tasty.
* 1 - [Snowdrift](http://www.snowdriftcider.com) Dry, 7.4%, very very dry, tough to drink.  Don’t do this again
* 3 - Tieton, dry. Very nice. Smoother than the Seattle dry. 
* 2 - Finnriver Apple Abbey, 6.5%, unusual aftertaste but not bad at all. Almost smoky but not quite. Would try again but probably not at the top of my list. 
* 4 - Washington Golden Delicious, 5.5%, bright and sweet. Very tasty. 
* 3 - Core Hero Dry, %, lovely and dry 
* 3 - Seattle Semi-sweet, 6.5%, very nice
* 3 - Stella Cidre, 4.5%, not bad at all 
* 2 - Wheel Line Haystack, cask aged, smooth and dry 
* 5 - Ole Swede, mint tree & crabapple, wow! Superb! Citrusy
* 4 - Soundbite, Yup That's Dry, definitely dry but very nice finish. Nice if you want a dry cider. 
* 3 - 10 Barrel Soft Core, 6.5%, Semi-sweet to dry, nice flavor, not too tart 
* 2 - Finnriver Apple Abbey, 6.5%, wow tart! Funky aftertaste
* 4 - Washington Gold, 5.5%, replacement for Crispin at Henry's, nice sweet, not tangy 
* 3 - Schilling Rose Vacay, xx, really nice, definitely medium dry, not too sweet 
* 4 - Bad Granny Honeycrisp, 6.9% semi sweet, refreshing, might be really good — excellent
* 4 - Tieton Bourbon Peach, 6.9%, very nice, flavorful, not too sweet 
* 3 - Bad Granny Lime & Ginger, %, sweet, smooth, nice lime, hard to pick up the ginger, good flavors 
* 3 - One Tree Huckleberry, 6.8%, really sweet but actually a lovely taste
* 3 - Portland Concord Grape, 5.5%, sweet, almost (but not quite) tastes like Ribena. Not too bad, but nothing I’d want to drink on a regular basis
* 4 - Sea Cider Bittersweet, 9.1%, not bad. Rather dry, even though it’s classified semi-sweet
* 3 - Finnriver Oaken Haben, 6.5%, habanero cider. Nice taste, bit of a bite. 
* 4 - Dragon’s Head Heritage, 7.3%, dry but punchy, bright amber color, very British
* 4 - Tieton Lavender Honey, 6.9%, smooth but not too sweet. Definite lavender notes but not too overwhelming. 
* 5 - 2 Towns Outcider, 5%, ooh lovely very nice, smooth, semisweet, unfiltered Jonas Gold
* 4 - 2 Towns Cosmic Crisp, 6.4%, tart, not too sweet, cloudy pale appearance but pretty nice.
