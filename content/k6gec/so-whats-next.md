Studying and, more importantly, finances have prevented me from actually getting too involved in the HF bands as I'd like. Here are a few things that I would like to accomplish:

1. My son wants to build a radio, and I would love to do that with him. Any recommendations for good kits?
2. I would very much like to learn Morse code at an acceptable level. I think it would be very cool to take a tiny CW QRP rig with me as a travel (I travel a lot for work) and then be able to make contacts in a number of new locations. Now that I've passed the Extra exam, this is likely where I'll focus next.
3. I have in mind to re-purpose an older Yaesu FT60R with a Raspberry Pi to use as an [APRS](http://k6gec.com/2014/04/21/what-is-aprs/) Internet gateway. I'm thinking that it should be fairly trivial to do.
4. Once my son and I build the radio, I'll obviously need some sort of HF antenna in the back yard or attic to use with it.
5. Our family has a ranch in west Texas; I'd love to be able to set up a station for use while we're there. (It's so remote that there's no cellphone coverage.)

What do _you_ have in your ham radio plans?
