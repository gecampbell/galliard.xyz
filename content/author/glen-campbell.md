I was born in 1961 the fetid swamps of southeast Texas, in the city
of Beaumont, near the Big Thicket, in what is locally referred to
as The Golden Triangle (the three points of which are Beaumont,
Port Arthur, and Orange). The so-called Golden Triangle has one of
the highest incidences of childhood leukemia on earth, mainly because
the petrochemical industry (which provides most of what makes the
Triangle Golden). My mother was a teacher&mdash;my own first-grade
teacher, in fact&mdash;and from her I derived my love of reading
and learning and an insatiable fascination with Reader's Digest
that lasts to this day. My father was a technician at the local
Goodyear Beaumont Chemical plant, a business at which I worked for
two hot summers after high school, thus utterly cementing my desire
to flee the area at the first available opportunity. From him I
inherited a [love of gadgets](/essays/gadgets.html)
but not his mechanical skills.

Growing up in Beaumont, I was introduced to some of the beautiful
things on this earth: we spent many weekends and weeks camping,
fishing, and generally enjoying the beaches, woods, mountains, and
lakes all over the United States. We took summer vacations to the
Grand Canyon, the Great Salt Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Big
Bend, the Appalachian Mountains, Florida, New England, and most
parts in between. I have been blessed to travel immensely, and will
be eternally grateful for the experience, though I may not have
shown my appreciation at the time.

In Beaumont, too, [I was introduced to
music](/essays/classical-music.html). I
played drums in the band; more importantly, I learned to write music
and was encouraged by my band and orchestra directors. My high
school orchestra (Forest Park, now called West Brook) won Texas
State Honor Orchestra during my senior year. Our conductor, Dean
Fishburn, was a man of poor morals and huge passion who somehow
converted a truly rag-tag bunch of students into the finest high-school
orchestra in the state. At the same time, we formed a jazz band led
by the inimitable Don Knapp&mdash;since the jazz band was formed
ad hoc and thus had no budget, we used his "book"&mdash;an amazing
collection of original scores of the greatest Big Band hits of the
1940's and 50's.

My love of music led me to attend [Baylor
University](http://www.baylor.edu) in Waco, Texas, on a music
composition scholarship. While there, I helped form a Christian
rock band named SpiritWind, one of the first CamelCase bands in
existence. We toured and performed, and I loved every minute of it.
Ultimately, however, I tired of music and finally graduated with a
degree in English Language and Literature, which I promptly ignored.

I left Waco and moved to Austin to take a job with a good friend
of mine who ran a small startup computer company. I wrote device
drivers in Z80 assembly code and acted as an onsite consultant to
our customers. Ultimately, a failed investment by Ross Perot led
to the closure of the company, and I took a job with the Texas
Education Agency, where I met (and married) my lovely wife, Anita.
I worked for a while for BMC Software, then went to work for another
startup, Evolutionary Technologies International (ETI).

I was with ETI for nearly eight years; the last four of which I
lived and worked in Europe. Living as an expatriate was a life-changing
experience; there's nothing like living and working in a foreign
environment to teach you how to relate to people of different
cultures.

Eventually, I moved and and came to live in Silicon Valley in 2000.
After a string of startups and lengthy periods of unemployment
caused by the 9/11 incident and subsequent economic downturn, I
went to work for Yahoo! News in October, 2004. I have played various
roles in launching and upgrading many sites within the Media division.

In 2009, I became interested in the ukulele, mainly through the influence
of such musical geniuses as
[Jake Shimabukoru](http://www.jakeshimabukuro.com/home/) and
[Julia Nunes](http://www.julianunes.com). I enjoy the ukulele but I
am basically competent and not skilled. The ukulele has an advantage
over the guitar in that it's more portable.

In 2010, we moved back to Texas when I took a job with 
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com)
in San Antonio. I started out as an integration architect on the
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org) team and I later help start
the Developer Relations Group.

In 2015, I moved on to an engineering manager position with
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) and moved to Seattle, WA.
