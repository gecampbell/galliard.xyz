I was born in 1961 the fetid swamps of southeast Texas, in the city
of Beaumont, near the Big Thicket, in what is locally referred to
as The Golden Triangle (the three points of which are Beaumont,
Port Arthur, and Orange). The so-called Golden Triangle has one of
the highest incidences of childhood leukemia on earth, mainly because
of the local petrochemical industry (which provides most of what
makes the Triangle Golden).

My mother was a teacher (my own first-grade teacher, in fact) and
from her I derived my love of reading and learning and an insatiable
fascination with Reader's Digest that lasts to this day.[^1] My
father was a technician at the local Goodyear Beaumont Chemical
plant, a business at which I worked for two hot summers after high
school, thus utterly cementing my desire to flee the area at the
first available opportunity. From him I inherited a [love of
gadgets](/essay/2012/01/gadgets.html) but not his mechanical skills.

Growing up in Beaumont, I was introduced to some of the beautiful
things on this earth: we spent many weekends and weeks camping,
fishing, and generally enjoying the beaches, woods, mountains, and
lakes all over the United States. We took summer vacations to the
Grand Canyon, the Great Salt Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Big
Bend, the Appalachian Mountains, Florida, New England, and most
parts in between. I have been blessed to travel immensely, and will
be eternally grateful for the experience, though I may not have
shown my appreciation at the time.

In Beaumont, too, [I was introduced to
music](/essay/2012/02/classical-music.html). I played drums in the
band; more importantly, I learned to write music and was encouraged
by my band and orchestra directors. My high school orchestra (Forest
Park, now called West Brook) won Texas State Honor Orchestra during
my senior year. Our conductor, Dean Fishburn, was a man of poor
morals and huge passion who somehow converted a truly rag-tag bunch
of students into the finest high-school orchestra in the state. At
the same time, we formed a jazz band led by the inimitable Don
Knapp&mdash;since the jazz band was formed ad hoc and thus had no
budget, we used his "book"&mdash;an amazing collection of original
scores of the greatest Big Band hits of the 1940's and 50's.

My love of music led me to attend [Baylor
University](http://www.baylor.edu) in Waco, Texas, on a music
composition scholarship. While there, I helped form a Christian
rock band named SpiritWind, one of the first CamelCase bands in
existence. We toured and performed, and I loved every minute of it.
Ultimately, however, I tired of music and finally graduated with a
degree in English Language and Literature, which I promptly ignored.

I left Waco and moved to Austin to take a job with a good friend
of mine who ran a small startup computer company. I wrote device
drivers in Z80 assembly code and acted as an onsite consultant to
our customers. Ultimately, a failed investment by Ross Perot led
to the closure of the company, and I took a job with the Texas
Education Agency, where I met (and married) my lovely wife, Anita.
I worked for a while for BMC Software, then went to work for another
startup, Evolutionary Technologies International (ETI).

I was with ETI for nearly eight years; the last four of which I
lived and worked in Europe. Living as an expatriate was a life-changing
experience; there's nothing like living and working in a foreign
environment to teach you how to relate to people of different
cultures.

Eventually, I moved and and came to live in Silicon Valley in 2000.
After a string of startups and lengthy periods of unemployment
caused by the 9/11 incident and subsequent economic downturn, I
went to work for [Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com) in October,
2004. I have played various roles in launching and upgrading many
sites within the Media division of Yahoo!

In 2009, I became interested in the ukulele, mainly through the
influence of such musical geniuses as [Jake
Shimabukoru](http://www.jakeshimabukuro.com/home/) and [Julia
Nunes](http://www.julianunes.com). I enjoy the ukulele but I am
basically competent and not skilled. The ukulele has an advantage
over the guitar in that it's more portable.

In 2010, we moved back to Texas when I took a job with
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) in San Antonio. I started out
as an integration architect on the [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org)
team and I later help [start the Developer Relations
Group](/essay/2012/05/developing-for-the-cloud.html).

In 2015, I moved on to an engineering manager position with
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) and moved to Seattle, WA. In October
of 2015, we purchased a house in Lynnwood, WA, where we live today.

I drive a Jeep Wrangler and my amateur radio callsign is
[K6GEC](http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=2785484).

      "insatiable fascination with Reader's Digest."
