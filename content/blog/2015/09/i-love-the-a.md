I have to be honest, the reason I love the
[Galliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliard_(typeface\))
typeface is because of the lowercase "a."

When I was in third grade, my older brother Ted was doing something
with calligraphy. Like a typical third-grader, I'm pretty sure that
I was annoying him by wanting to know what he was up to, since he
was the cool older brother. (Warren was the oldest, but he was so
old I didn't see him a lot, and Mark was older than me but close
enough so that we got into trouble together.)

Ted could have responded as a typical big brother: he could have
told me to go away, or pushed me out the window, or moved to another
room to be away from me. But, instead, he gave me a broad pen and
a [Speedball](http://www.speedballart.com) calligraphy manual and
told me to do it myself.

The first calligraphic hand I learned was
[Blackletter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter).  That's
the ornate style used in late medieval Germany, and is often called
Gothic or (erroneously) "Old English." I got good enough at it to
impress the kids at school, and moved on to other styles of lettering.
Italic, Celtic, and various invented styles were all part of my
repertoire.

While attending [college in Waco, Texas](http://baylor.edu), I
actually made money as a calligrapher.  I went to work for a company
there that sold religious knick-knacks; among them was a personalized
name card. It had your name (handlettered by me) and a vaguely-related
scripture verse. Every afternoon, I would come into their workshop
and sit down at a stack of name cards that had been ordered the day
before, and patiently write out each name.  I was quite good at it,
and I like to think that I did good work.

A few decades before that, however, Matthew Carter was working on
a new typeface for Mergenthaler Linotype, inspired by the 16th-century
typeface of Robert Granjon he cut about 1570. Granjon is more notably
known for his slanted type founts that later came to be known as
Italic, which is one of the more popular calligraphic styles in the
modern era.

Those type faces achieved their characteristic shapes by the use
of the flat, broad pen that is now the basis for modern calligraphy.
By holding the pen steady at a fixed angle, it makes broad strokes
when pulled down, but fine lines when moved laterally. While this
makes sense to most people when they see it, it was actually a skill
that was lost to the world for several centuries, until rediscovered
by the [Arts and Crafts
movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement), whose
best-known proponent, [William
Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris) helped to
popularize the craft in the late 19th century.  (Until then, artists
thought that you had to rotate or twirl a fine, flexible pen to
achieve the thick and thin strokes, which led to the beautiful but
very difficult
[Spenserian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencerian_script) or
Copperplate script.)

The "a" of the Galliard font is based on that flat, broad pen, held
at a slight angle. The top of the
[counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface_anatomy) (the
central closed loop of the "a") is nearly flat, showing the sideways
pen stroke. The ascender is broad, indicating the more vertical,
roughly downward, pull of the pen.  The rest of the Galliard typeface
is informed by the same pen-based mechanics. For example, the serif
at the top of the "l" and "i" are wedge-shaped rather than slightly
curved, which is easier to do with a pen (the serifs at the bottom
are more traditional).

Type design is one of the most subtle of the arts. 
The distinctions between one font and another are often based upon
minimal variations in ratios, and not any absolute, large-scale 
changes. After all, the glyphs must still represent the letters
of the language, and too much variation makes it unreadable.
