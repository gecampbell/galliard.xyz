Our family is a big fan of waffles. Growing up, my mother (and her mother)
always served waffles with chocolate icing. We still like to add chocolate
chips or other ingredients, but these basic waffles should work with anything,
or even just butter and syrup. 

Dry ingredients:

* 2 cups flour
* 2 T. baking powder
* 1 t. salt

Wet ingredients:

* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 1 3/4 cup milk (or cream)
* 2 t. vanilla

Detailed instructions:

1. Preheat the waffle iron. (Um, if you didn't know this, you should probably 
avoid the kitchen in the future.)
2. Mix the wet and dry ingredients separately, then whisk them together. 
1. Drop by large spoonfuls on your waffle iron and cook until done.
