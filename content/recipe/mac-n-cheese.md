This is my variation of [Alton Brown's Stovetop Mac'n'Cheese](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/stove-top-mac-n-cheese-recipe/index.html).  I chose to modify his, not because I think I'm a superior chef, but because his recipe used strange volumes of ingredients; for example, his version calls for 10 ounces of cheese, but all the bagged shredded cheese in the grocery store comes in 8 or 12 ounce packages.

## Ingredients

* 12 ounces elbow macaroni
* 6 tablespoons butter
* 2 eggs
* 12 ounces evaporated milk
* 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce (more to taste)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* Fresh black pepper
* 3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
* 12 ounces sharp cheddar, shredded

## Directions

In a large pot of boiling, salted water cook the pasta to al dente and drain. Return to the pot and melt in the butter. Toss to coat.

Whisk together the eggs, milk, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and mustard. Stir into the pasta and add the cheese. Over low heat continue to stir for 3 minutes or until creamy.
