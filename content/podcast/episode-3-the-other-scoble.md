Alex Scoble is best known for being the sibling of [Robert Scoble](http://scobleizer.com), but he's a fascinating person in his own right. He's a computer security expert working with payment card systems, a blogger on IT Management, and a home theater enthusiast. We talk about those things, as well as "the chat room problem" and other social media foibles. You can follow Alex on [his blog](http://itmanager.blogs.com) or on [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/itblogger). This episode was recorded on March 21, 2010
