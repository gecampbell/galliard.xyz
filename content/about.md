Galliard is a typeface designed by Matthew Carter and published by
the International Typeface Corporation in 1978.  It is also the
name of a Renaissance-era dance that was popular all over Europe
in the 16th century.

Thus, the name represents both a beautiful experience (especially
with regards to reading) as well as the playful exuberance of dance.
Both these elements are hopefully present in this website, and in
life as well.

These writings are an attempt to capture, in words, the beauty,
precision, and playfulness of life and the world around us.

I maintain a number of mailing lists; [click here to see all of
them](http://broadpool.email).  A [mailing
list](http://glenc.co/essay/2015/09/the-mailing-list.html) is
a wonderful way to discuss the things we've found online, or to
find people with similar interests.  You can receive messages bunched
in a daily digest, or you can get them individually.  You can set
up filters in your email program so that all the (relevant) messages
are grouped together.

I no longer allow comments on this site; because of the low volume
of visitors, most of those comments would only have been seen by
me.  If you join a mailing list, there's an instant community of
folks with whom you can discuss what you've found.
