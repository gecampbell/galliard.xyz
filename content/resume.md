I am an experienced software development manager with experience
delivering large-scale systems and the complete software development
lifecycle. In the past, I've been a developer and systems architect,
though I haven't done much coding in the last few years.

However, even though some consider the term  "old-fashioned" these
days, I tend to think of myself as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis">systems
analyst</a>; that is, my primary skill is the ability to visualize
and solve problems related to integrating large-scale systems such
as high-volume distributed systems, large websites, service-oriented
network architectures, data warehouses, and other software constructs.
I have a proven track record of launching large-scale software
projects; I was the architect and lead developer for the first
service-oriented architecture (SOA) website at Yahoo!, and I've
launched numerous other large-scale sites and products since then.

In the past, I've been a consultant and architect of data warehouses
and very large extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes.

### Employment History

#### [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com), Seattle, WA (2015-present).

Currently a software development manager for Amazon retail pricing.
While at Amazon, I have lead teams involved in competitive matching,
business intelligence/data engineering, user experience, and
application workflow management.  During my time at Amazon, I was
a key participant on initiatives surrounding the automation of
Amazon retail pricing and worked with stakeholders on key components
of pricing systems related to price perception.

While I cannot discuss the details of many of these projects, most
of them involved large-scale distributed systems as well as
near-real-time processing of data. We also worked with significant
back-end data systems for use by machine-learning engineers and
data scientists.

As a development manager, I not only had software developers as my
direct reports but also other development managers. Beyond the
purely technical and project work, I helped to mentor new managers
and engineers and develop training programs for use across the
organization.

#### [Rackspace Hosting](http://www.rackspace.com), San Antonio, TX (2010-2015).

I was a software development manager in the Developer Experience
team, part of the Rackspace Cloud products team (and was a founder
of the Developer Relations Group, its immediate predecessor).  This
team develops language bindings (Software Development Kits) for <a
href="http://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> and <a
href="http://www.openstack.org">OpenStack</a> products and works
with developers to adopt and utilize the Rackspace public cloud
products. My first major deliverable was the
[php-opencloud](http://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud) library,
an open-source API for OpenStack and Rackspace services. We also
manage the [Rackspace Developer site](https://developer.rackspace.com)
and participate in a number of developer outreach programs. I also
spent time in developer outreach activities, such as speaking at
conferences, workshops, and meetups.

Previous to this role, I was an architect and product manager on
the Rackspace Cloud team working on the latest iteration of the
Compute product line, which is based on the OpenStack Compute (Nova)
project. In this role, I worked with many other teams inside Rackspace
to integrate the new product fully into the business systems and
other processes within the company. I designed a scheduler service
for OpenStack Compute and defined administrative APIs for use by
Rackspace operations teams.

In addition to my direct work with the Compute product line, I was
also an architect for an internal Rackspace initiative that involves
a major transformation of our internal systems into a service-oriented
architecture (SOA) around our major cloud products.

#### [Yahoo! Inc.](http://www.yahoo.com), Sunnyvale, CA (2004-2010).

I held a number of positions while at Yahoo!:

* *Social Media Architect, Media Integration Team, 2010.*
  As the social media architect for the Yahoo! Media group, I was responsible
  for defining and driving integration with Facebook, Twitter, and other social
  media websites, as well as advocating best practices for user data management
  and retention.
* *Sr. Engineering Manager, Media Integration Team, 2009-10*
  In this position, I manage  engineers involved in multiple projects that
  support the Yahoo! Media anchor properties [News](http://news.yahoo.com),
  [Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com),
  [Sports](http://sports.yahoo.com),
  and various other smaller properties. Since this was a new team, I was
  involved in establishing a management structure, defining internal processes
  and architecture, and helped to build a collaborative environment rich in
  technical expertise. In addition, I have also been active as an individual
  contributor, coordinating efforts to bring WordPress to Yahoo! and developing
  the professional blogging tools for use by Yahoo! Media sites. As an engineer,
  I developed and deployed systems on Linux (Redhat 4 and 5), written code in
  PHP, configured Apache servers, and handled various internal security issues.
  I designed the overall architecture for the professional blogging solution,
  ensuring that it is highly scalable, secure, and redundant.
* *Sr. Engineering Manager, [Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/), 2008-09*
  In this role, I managed a team of backend engineers; during this time, we
  delivered major new revisions to the News site. Our work also ensured that the
  site could support extremely high-traffic events such as the 2008 Presidential
  Election, the 2009 Inauguration, and the untimely death of Michael Jackson.
  During this time, Yahoo! News achieved and then maintained its position as the
  #1 News property on the Internet. I led my team in developing good engineering
  practices, organizing sub-groups, and reporting on critical project
  deliverables. While I was a manager on News, we moved to a fully
  service-oriented architecture (SOA), which proved to be more scalable than the
  previous one.
* *Engineering Manager, [Yahoo! Shine](http://shine.yahoo.com/), 2007-08*
  I led a team of engineers in developing the first property at Yahoo! to be
  entirely driven by user-generated content. I worked with product managers and
  upper management to negotiate initial product features and schedules, and led
  the team to achieve those commitments. In addition, I designed, implemented,
  and tested the overall system architecture as well as the caching systems
  involved. I also personally handled last-minute performance testing and cache
  optimization using HTTPperf and other tools.
* *Technical Lead and Engineering Manager, <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Tech</a>, 2005-07*
  I was initially the technical lead (engineer) for this product, and moved into
  a management role after the initial delivery. Yahoo! Tech was the first new
  media property to be developed at Yahoo! in over five years, and the first
  site within Yahoo! to use a totally service-oriented architecture (SOA). We
  led the way in implementing new technologies and frameworks at Yahoo!, and my
  team members have gone on to be widely-recognized experts throughout Yahoo! I
  designed and developed the web services architecture, including the
  integration of various services from throughout the Yahoo! organization. I
  wrote much of the API code in PHP and deployed it using FreeBSD, MySQL, and
  Apache, and implemented a caching system using
  <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a> and
  Yahoo! internal tools.
* *Backend Engineer, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! News</a>, 2004-05*
  In my first role at Yahoo!, I worked with other engineers to deliver a total
  redesign of the News property, moving from legacy code to a site that was
  completely implemented in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and using
  MySQL, Linux, and Apache.

#### Data Warehouse Engineer, <a href="http://www.blazent.com">Blazent</a>, Inc.</strong>, San Mateo, CA (2004).

I helped develop data warehouse architectures and policies for this
small start-up company that focused on Business Intelligence
applications for Information Technology departments. I worked with
Oracle, MySQL, and various ETL applications (Informatica, Embarcadero,
Ascential) in defining the ETL processes for the application.

#### Sales Consultant, [Informatica](http://www.informatica.com), Inc., Redwood City, CA (2003-2004).

As a Sales Consultant, I provided technical expertise on the
Informatica suite of ETL/data integration tools during the sales
process. This included product demonstrations, trade show participation,
and on-site proof-of-concept projects. I also worked with Informatica's
acquired changed-data-capture products using IBM DB2 and ORACLE.

#### Independent Contractor (2001-2003).

During this period, I participated in numerous projects including
data warehouses for a major bank in San Francisco and for a large
government agency in British Columbia. These projects included the
design and development of ETL processes using tools such as Ab
Initio, Oracle, DB2, and ETI&dot;EXTRACT. I also participated in several
small start-ups and worked with VC firms on various projects.

#### Director of Software Engineering, DotRocket, Inc., Campbell, CA (2000-2001).

I was in charge of producing a web traffic data warehouse product
for this startup company that focused on Internet bandwidth
optimization. A prototype of the data warehouse was designed and
implemented using Perl, PHP, and MySQL before the company ceased
operations because of lack of funding. I managed a team of employees
and contractors during this period.

#### Managing Director of European Operations, Legendary Data Systems, Reading, Berkshire (United Kingdom; 1999-2001).

As the country manager for this US consulting firm establishing a
foothold in Europe, I hired and managed a team of consultants,
developed and maintained customers, grew a partner base, worked
with legal staff and other specialists, and delivered an organization
that significantly contributed revenue to the company's bottom line
in a period when the US operations had stagnated. Projects included
data integration and data warehouses in conjunction with Natwest
Bank, Plc, IBM Germany, and Evolutionary Technologies, Ltd. I was
responsible for substantial new lines of business as well as
Legendary's first major customer success story in Europe (Barmer
Ersatzkasse in Wuppertal).

#### Evolutionary Technologies International (ETI), in Austin, TX, and Wokingham, Berkshire (UK); 1992-1999.

(Note: firm is now defunct)

While with ETI, I started as a software engineer and was promoted
to engineering manager. Using ETI tools, I developed or helped
develop "data system libraries" that generated code in C, COBOL,
JCL, and various other languages; these libraries generate programs
that accessed various database and storage systems including DB2,
Oracle, IDS, and IDMS.

During this period, I helped the company grow from 16 employees to
a multinational organization with more than 400 employees on three
continents with annual revenue in excess of US$40M. I established
the company's first technical support team. I became a consultant,
first in the US and then on a long-term assignment in Europe. I
worked with numerous customers in the United States, the United
Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, South Africa, and
Italy. (Note that consultants with ETI worked in both a pre-sales
and post-sales capacity.)

I helped ETI Europe deliver more than US$20M in revenue while I
managed a team of consultants in the UK, France, and Germany. I
helped develop close relationships with partners such as IBM France
and IBM Sweden. My final title with ETI was <em>Manager of European
Consulting</em>. During my time with ETI, I helped to deploy more
than 40 major data warehouse or data migration projects, as well
as assisting in closing many new customers.

#### Technical Writer, <a href="http://www.bmc.com">BMC Software</a></strong>, Austin, TX (1991-1992).
I produced reference and end-user documentation for the <a
href="http://www.bmc.com/products/product-listing/22981-2004-2265.html?intcmp=PF_22981-2004-2265">ALTER

href="http://www.bmc.com/products/product-listing/22999-2032-22999-2032-2247.html">CHANGE
MANAGER for DB2</a> products. I worked closely with the engineering
staff and with other technical writers and editors.

#### Systems Analyst, <a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us">Texas Education Agency</a></strong>, Austin, TX (1988-1991).
I helped in the development of the <a
href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/peims/">Public Education Information
Management System</a> (PEIMS), the first large-scale data warehouse
that focused on the needs of Texas Educators. In addition, I helped
develop an order tracking and management system for the purchase
and shipping of textbooks to the more than 1,100 Texas school
districts.

#### System Support Specialist, Commercial Systems, Inc.</strong>, Austin, TX (1984-1988).
I wrote Z80 assembler device drivers and provided end-user support
and consulting for this small start-up computer manufacturer.
